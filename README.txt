My thoughts about the code:


Upon initial review, the code appears to be functional, but there are areas that could benefit from refactoring to improve readability, maintainability, and adherence to coding best practices. Some specific areas of concern include:

1. Lack of separation of concerns: The controller contains both validation logic and database operations. It would be better to move the validation logic to separate request classes to promote better code organization and reusability.

2. Use of hardcoded values: Some values, such as email addresses and pagination limits, are hardcoded directly in the code. It would be better to abstract such values to configuration files or constants for easier maintenance and flexibility.

3. Inconsistent naming conventions: The naming conventions used in the code are not consistent. It's important to follow a consistent naming convention for variables, functions, and classes to improve code readability.

4. Limited error handling: The error handling in the code is minimal, and exceptions are not properly caught and handled. This can lead to unexpected behavior or unhandled exceptions being displayed to users.

5. Seprate repository should be created like both users and jobs models are direclty used in BookingRepository seprating the repositories will result in clear and consice code easy to read and understand.
